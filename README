=================  MotionTrackOSC  =================
=========== (c) 2009 - Marije Baalman ==============
================== www.nescivi.nl ==================

MotionTrackOSC is a small program that does motiontracking
 on either a camera image or a video file.
The tracked motion is output to a client via osc.

The program is based on the libraries
OpenCV - http://opencv.willowgarage.com
liblo  - http://liblo.sourceforge.net

I wrote the program using opencv v1.1pre1 on Linux, though
 maybe an earlier version of OpenCV (such as shipped with
 Debian or other distributions) will also work.
I did NOT yet use the newest version of liblo (v0.25 or
 higher), since that is not shipped with Debian unstable
 yet (even though it has a really nice feature).


================== Build ================

To build the application you need scons.

You build it by doing:

scons
(sudo) scons install

You can add a PREFIX to define the location for installation of the binary application
 The default is (/usr/local/).


Installing the SuperCollider files:

scons SC
installs the files to ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/MotionTrackOSC

(sudo) scons SC SCPATH=/usr/local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions
installs the files to /usr/local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/MotionTrackOSC

On OSX [1] for a local install you would do:
scons SCPATH="~/Library/Application\ Support/SuperCollider/Extensions"

See also below for a note on OSX 10.6.

================== Startup ================

motiontracker <device or file> <target_port> <recv_port> <target_ip>

The defaults are:

device 0
target_port 57120 (to send to)
recv_port   57151 (to listen on)
target_ip   "127.0.0.1"

Devices are indicated using a single digit number
Videofiles are indicated by their pathname

================= HOT KEYS ================
ESC - quit
p   - pause
o   - hide
l   - help
w,e - mhi duration down,up
s,d - max time delta down,up
x,c - min time delta down,up
t,y - prediction down,up
g,h - difference down,up
b,n - motion threshold down,up
f,r - max area down,up

=================== OSC ===================

OSC messages it understands:

    /motiontrack/info -- get info on current parameters

    /motiontrack/mhidur       -f- motion history duration (seconds)
    /motiontrack/maxdelta     -f- max delta time (seconds)
    /motiontrack/mindelta     -f- min delta time (seconds)
    /motiontrack/prediction   -f- portion of rectangle to predict position
    /motiontrack/threshold    -f- motion threshold (fraction of frame area)
    /motiontrack/difference   -i- difference threshold (integer)
    /motiontrack/maxarea      -i- minimum size of area to be tracked (integer) (max area ignored? I should probably rename this parameter)

    /motiontrack/subscribe            -i- subscribe to all data
    /motiontrack/subscribe/position   -i- subscribe to position
    /motiontrack/subscribe/direction  -i- subscribe to direction
    /motiontrack/subscribe/rectangle  -i- subscribe to rectangle
    /motiontrack/subscribe/prediction -i- subscribe to predicted

    /motiontrack/hide         -i- hide the visual indication of tracked items
    /motiontrack/hidecamera   -i- do not update the direct camera output

    /motiontrack/pause  -i- pause tracking
    /motiontrack/quit   -- quit application

OSC messages it sends:
    All the parameter messages (as confirmation of setting and in reply to info)

	/motiontrackosc/started     --    application has started

    /motiontrack/position   -iff-   id, center x, center y,
    /motiontrack/direction  -ifff-  id, dir x, dir y, angle
    /motiontrack/rectangle  -iffff- id, corner 1 x, corner 1 y, corner 2 x, corner 2 y
    /motiontrack/predicted -iff-   id, predicted x, predicted y
	/motiontrack/framedone -i-     number of valid areas found

    /motiontrackosc/quit     -s-    application has quit

All coordinates are send as floats between 0 and 1 (i.e. they are automatically
 scaled to the used capture size.

=========== SuperCollider ========

MotionTrackOSC is distributed with two classes for SuperCollider; one which implements the OSC interface and makes the data usable in SC. The other allows for some further processing of the data.
Look in the help files to see how it works.

============ ChangeLog ===========

17/03/2009 - v0.2a - added missing SuperCollider classes and some documentation updates
16/03/2009 - v0.2 - additional parameters, extra SuperCollider class.
				- this version has been used in the Chronotopia (with Attakkalari Centre for Movement, Bangalore) production.
06/01/2009 - v0.1 - first release

============ Notes =================

[1] From Jochen Otto, Sept. 19, 2009

The changes in OS X 10.6 basically broke OpenCV's Quicktime/Carbon GUI  
functionality.

There is a workaround which allows building OpenCV on 64bit  
architecture, however, without any QT/Carbon support.

See here on the issue:
http://trac.macports.org/ticket/21014
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV/message/65895

A ticket is filed at OpenCV on Sourceforge, too: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2859071&group_id=22870&atid=376677
